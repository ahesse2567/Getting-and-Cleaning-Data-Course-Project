## Explanation of Scrips

There is only script to clean this data. That script is "run_analysis.R".

## Data Notes

The original zip file is stored in the "data_raw" folder. The extracted data can be found in the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder. The latter folder also contains the two tidy datasets. It also contains a file called "README.txt". This is the original README file that came with the raw data. The README.md file you're currently viewing is my README file I generated for this project.
